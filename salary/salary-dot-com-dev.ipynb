    "### Inspect the data extraction options\n",
    "Now that we have the raw html, let's take a look at it to see how we might be able to extract the data. The first thing I always look at when I'm trying to scrape data is, can I access it directly through some backend api that returns data in json format? The way I look for this is by looking through the network activity. Typically, this will show up if you filter to XHR. And if you look at the response, you will see clearly formatted json data. Unfortuanately, that is not the case with this project, but you can see something like this in the [Yahoo! Finance](https://github.com/israel-dryer/Yahoo-Finance-Scraper) project where I extract historical stock data using a hidden api.\n",
    "\n",
    "### json formatted data\n",
    "The good news, is that we have something almost as good. The next thing I usually look for is json formatted data that is embedded in the html data. So, right-click on the web-page and then click \"view page source\". Then, if you scroll down about mid-way, you'll notice some clearly formatted json data, that we can extract from the page, formatted as a python dictionary. This is fantastic, because it make the work SO MUCH EASIER! Not only do we have all of the quintiles broken out, but we also have the locality data and a nice description of the job title.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting the script\n",
    "You can see that the data is embedded in a *script* tag. However, there are multiple scripts here. The one that we want has a specific type \"application/ld+json\". That will narrow it a bit, but it won't be specific enough. If you look at these two scripts, you'll notice that they have an \"@Type\" key. One is called occupation, and the other is called \"Organization\". This corresponds to the comments above as well. What we can do to specific this exact script is to add a simple regular expression pattern that looks for the word \"Organization\"."
